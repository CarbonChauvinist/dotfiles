#Should be able to drop the long update-environment chain below for following:
#Still not sure if this is really needed? Issues I was having with ?XDG_SESSION_TYPE? not being set in tmux sessions seems to have gone away
#Update bash to latest tmux environment on reattaching
#showenv has a `-s` option now to format the output as bourne shell commands, so I think `eval $(tmux showenv -s ...)` should do the job of this script now.

#By default, some of the environment is set when starting the tmux server (when starting the first session), not just any new session.
#make tmux remember the variables that you want to keep from the outside environment. I used ones that differed between locally using Gnome Terminal and remotely using Terminal.app. Some of them probably aren't necessary, but I'm not sure which. The -g flag might not be correct.
